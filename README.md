# Microservices with Moleculer

Created microservices with the [Moleculer framework](https://moleculer.services).

There are 3 very simple services (user, email, auth) with actions to mock/simulate creating a user, getting users, sending an email and authenticating a user.

## Usage

Run the services:

```bash
npm start
```
